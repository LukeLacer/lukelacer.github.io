## Getting started

If you wanna see my site, just click in this link: <a href="lukelacer.github.io">lukelacer.github.io</a>
The site is simplified for everyone understand and enjoy the code for any purposes they want. This is a static site, with no SPA or big features, this is just HTML, CSS and Javascript for a little of sparkle things. :sparkler:
